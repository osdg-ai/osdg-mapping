data = { 'query': """Using satellite data on deforestation and weather in Malawi and 
        linking those datasets with household survey datasets, we estimate the causal 
        effect of deforestation on access to clean drinking water. In the existing 
        literature on forest science and hydrology, the consensus is that 
        deforestation increases water yield. In this study, we directly examine the 
        causal effect of deforestation on householdsâ€™ access to clean drinking water. 
        Results of the two-stage least-squares (2SLS) with cluster and time fixed-effect 
        estimations illustrate strong empirical evidence that deforestation decreases 
        access to clean drinking water. Falsification tests show that the possibility of 
        our instrumental variable picking up an unobserved time trend is very unlikely. 
        We find that a 1.0-percentage-point increase in deforestation decreases access 
        to clean drinking water by 0.93 percentage points. With this estimated impact, 
        deforestation in the last decade in Malawi (14%) has had the same magnitude of 
        effect on access to clean drinking water as that of a 9% decrease in rainfall.
