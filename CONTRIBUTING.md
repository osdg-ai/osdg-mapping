# How to contribute to OSDG?

The OSDG project welcomes contributions from all users and communities. We have identified several areas, which could benefit the project the most:

1) Suggest new data sources - If you have a data source or a classifier to recognize one or more SDG, you can suggest it to be added to the OSDG data sources.
2) Suggest new/better rules for data source cleaning / integration.
3) Suggest improvements to the procedure for matching the items in the combined ontology to the Fields of Study in Microsoft Academic.

This can be done  in various ways :
    a) by posting an issue on OSDG GitHub ;
    b) by contacting the team at [osdg@technote.ai](mailto:osdg@technote.ai);
    c) By forking there project repository, integrating the new data and then creating a pull request(read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)).
