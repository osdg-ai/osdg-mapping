## About the project
In short, OSDG-mapping builds an **integrated ontology** from the feature sets identified in previous research, and then matches the ontology items to the topics from [Microsoft Academic](https://academic.microsoft.com/home).

**Check out our paper on ArXiv [OSDG -- Open-Source Approach to Classify Text Data by UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14569)**

OSDG takes relevant text features (such as ontology items, features from machine-learning models or extracted keywords) from the previous research, cleans them and merges them into a comprehensive, constantly-growing OSDG ontology. The ontology items are mapped to the ever-growing list of topics/Fields of Study in the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG).
By doing this, we:
- expand the ontology â€“ acquire more key terms associated with the relevant MAG Topics, natively called Fields of Study (FOS);
- capture more nuanced relationships between individual terms and latent concepts.

OSDG-mapping integrates the existing research into a comprehensive approach, and does so in a way that evades the shortcomings of former individual approaches and duplication of research efforts.

## What OSDG-mapping is for?
OSDG-mapping constructs SDG relevant FOS ontology which is an important element of [OSDG-tool](https://github.com/osdg-ai/osdg-tool) .

## Procedure

Assigned labels from raw data sources are assembled in two steps:
1. Assembling terms `AssemblingTerms.py`\
**Assembles terms from `raw_data/0_add/` data sources.**
    * *Term label conflicts from sources `00_add_validated/` are ignored meaning if `term_1` is assigned to `SDG_1` by `source_1` and to `SDG_2` by `source_2` **&rarr;** `term_1` is assigned to both.*
    * *Conflicts for term labels from `01_add_generated/` data sources are managed in two ways:* 
        - *If the conflict is between validated and generated term label **&rarr;** generated term label is discarded while validated one remains.*
        - *If the conflict is between generated & generated **&rarr;** both are discarded.*

    **&rarr;** **produces** `InterimTerms.json`
    ```python
    {
        'SDG_1': {
            'term_1': ['source_1', 'source_2', ...],
            'term_2': ['source_1', 'source_3', ...]
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
    ```
2. Assembling OSDG Ontology `AssemblingOntology.py`\
    **Assembles FOS from `InterimTerms.json` and `02_add_all_to_all/` data sources.**
    * 2.1. *Terms from `InterimTerms.json` are matched to  MAG Fields of Study subset `FOSMAP.json` which contains over 150 thousand fields.*
    * 2.2. *Matched FOS are added to the final ontology `FOS-Ontology.json` .*
    * 2.3. *`02_add_all_to_all/` FOS are added to the final ontology `FOS-Ontology.json` .*
    * 2.4 *Final ontology `OSDG-Ontology.json` is adjusted based on `1_replace/` and `2_remove/` .*


    **&rarr;** **produces** `OSDG-Ontology.json`
    ```python
    {
        'SDG_1': ['fos_id_1', 'fos_id_2', ...],
        'SDG_2': ['fos_id_3', 'fos_id_4', ...]
        ...
    }
    ```
